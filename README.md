# 🧠 AI and Language Learning — Research Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the results of a survey on how students use artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the process of learning foreign languages. The research was conducted as part of a university assignment.

## 📘 Description

The notebook includes:
- Data cleaning and translation of responses
- Statistical analysis and visualization of survey results
- Insights into students’ motivation, tool usage, trust in AI, and learning outcomes

## 📊 Visualizations

1. **Languages Being Learned**  
   Pie chart showing which languages respondents are studying.

2. **AI Tools Usage**  
   Bar plot representing the frequency of various AI tools used for language learning.

3. **Frequency of AI Usage**  
   Pie chart showing how often respondents use AI assistants (daily, weekly, etc.).

4. **Effectiveness of AI vs Traditional Methods**  
   Bar plot comparing how respondents rate AI vs books, tutors, or courses.

5. **Trust in AI Information**  
   Pie chart illustrating how much students trust the information AI provides.

6. **Benefits of Using AI in Language Learning**
